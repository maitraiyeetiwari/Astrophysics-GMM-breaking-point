# Astrophysics-GMM-breaking-point
Here, I identified the first breaking point when plotting n_output vs n_input. n_input = number of input clusters for the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and n_output = number of output clusters identified by GMM.

The first breaking point mathematically is where d(n_output)/d(n_input) has its first minima. 

Both n_output vs input and d(n_output)/d(n_input) vs n_input plots are shown below. 

# Code and resources
Python version: 3.9.9
Packages: matplotlib
# Model Building
I used lists of n_output and n_input for three astrophysical sources (RCW49, RCW120 and NGC1977) to make the plots. The python scripts are atached.
