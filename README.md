# Astrophysics-output_vs_input
Here, I identified the first breaking point when plotting n_output vs n_input. n_input = number of input clusters for the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and n_output = number of output clusters identified by GMM.

# Code and resources
Python version: 3.9.9
Packages: matplotlib
# Model Building
I have used the 

I have used fits files of CII, 8micron and 870 micron images (in same resolution) to make an rgb fits file using make-rgb.py script. Then I plot this image displaying interesting regions (white boxes) and stars (pink) in RCW49, which is bright star-forming region in our Galaxy. 
# Note
I am not adding the CII, 8micron and 870 micron fits files because of their large sizes but the python scripts are attached.
